Is there a correlation between household economic factors and the appetite for nostalgia in the US?

Increase in production of nostalgia-based films:
  Remakes
  Reboots
  Prequels 
  Spin-offs

Why the increase?
  Are studios becoming lazy or losing creativity?
  Or have they discovered a value proposition in nostalgic films?

Considerations:
  Are personal income, employment rates, or other economic factors a leading predictor of  box office success for nostalgic films?
